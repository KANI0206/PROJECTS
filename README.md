WIRELESS ELECTRONIC NOTICE BOARD  - The notice board is connected to  GSM for displaying the current situation in the railway station and etc. It transmits the information wirelessly to the mobile device and shows the data on LCD. The Wireless Electronic Notice Board project is based on GSM technology, which is used in mobile phones.

SURFACE DISINFECTING ROBOT - This robot is fully automated, able to recognise obstacles and steer clear of them before a collision occurs. The robot's main job is to use UV germicidal irradiation to sterilise a space or a flat surface. UV LEDs on the robot are in charge of eliminating the infection. Ultrasonic sensor modules are used for detection because they outperform traditional IR-based obstacle avoidance sensors in almost every way.

WAREHOUSE SECURITY SYSTEM - The system acts as an identification system that gathers and sends message to the owner about the motion inside the warehouse. For this warehouse is fixed with a PIR Sensor to sense the undefined motion of human beings. A Temperature monitoring is also fixed, and connected to Arduino send data and receive instructions.
