WIRELESS ELECTRONIC NOTICE BOARD  - The notice board is connected to  GSM for displaying the current situation in the railway station and etc. 
It transmits the information wirelessly to the mobile device and shows the data on LCD. 
The Wireless Electronic Notice Board project is based on GSM technology, which is used in mobile phones.

SURFACE DISINFECTING ROBOT - This robot is fully automated, able to recognise obstacles and steer clear of them before a collision occurs. 
The robot's main job is to use UV germicidal irradiation to sterilise a space or a flat surface.
UV LEDs on the robot are in charge of eliminating the infection. 
Ultrasonic sensor modules are used for detection because they outperform traditional IR-based obstacle avoidance sensors in almost every way.

WAREHOUSE SECURITY SYSTEM - The system acts as an identification system that gathers and sends message to the owner about the motion inside the warehouse.
For this warehouse is fixed with a PIR Sensor to sense the undefined motion of human beings.
A Temperature monitoring is also fixed, and connected to Arduino send data and receive instructions.

DETECTION OF PARKINSON'S DISEASE - Parkinson's disease is a chronic disease and has no cure yet. We aims at detecting the disease at early stage using XGBoost Machine Learning Algorithm.XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is based on decision trees.In this Python machine learning project,
we'll create a model using an XGBClassifier using the Python packages scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost. After loading the data, obtaining the features and labels, scaling the features, splitting the dataset, and creating an XGBClassifier, we will determine the model's correctness.

SONAR SIGNAL PROCESSING IN GAUSSIAN ENVIRONMENT -  Sonar signal processing in a gaussian environment is an important aspect of underwater acoustic communication.Gaussian noise is commonly present in underwater channels, which affects the transmission and reception of sonar signals. This project aims to reduce the deviation as much as possible so that the receive signal which is reflected accurately. We also analysed the detector performance using region of convergence curves and we are detecting the target in the underwater Using a rectangular waveform, and the active sonar system detect the two well-separated targets in shallow water.
